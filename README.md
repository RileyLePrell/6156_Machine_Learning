# Machine Learning 

Organizations, across all industries, are collecting massive amounts of data at an accelerating pace. This brings many challenges, including data processing, storage, transformation, analysis, reporting, and operationalization. This course will cover the various aspects of these processes, with a focus on extracting actionable insights from the data. Special attention will be paid to statistical methods / machine learning methods that enable the analysis of data. Students will learn (a) the core principles, concepts, and methods of machine learning; (b) how to assess and evaluate learning methods; (c) how to design, develop, deploy, and utilize machine learning solutions to solve real-world challenges; and (d) how to present and communicate findings and results as actionable insights.
